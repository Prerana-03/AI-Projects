# AI-Projects 🚀
Introduction 🌟
The best way to develop your AI skills is by building projects. However, figuring out what to build can be difficult if you're just getting started. Here, I share 5 AI projects you can build quickly at three levels of sophistication. I’ll break down the steps and Python libraries needed to implement each idea.

The number one mistake beginners make when considering project ideas is starting with the question, "How can I use this new tech?" 🤔 While this can be a fine way to learn a new tool, there is a better approach.

Good project ideas start with the question, “What problem can I solve?” 💡 This mindset not only helps create a compelling narrative when sharing with potential employers but also translates technical skills into real value.

The following projects all take this problem-first approach. You can implement these ideas directly or, even better, use them as inspiration to solve a problem you are personally facing. 🛠️

Getting Started 🚀
To get started with any of these projects, you'll need to:

Install the required libraries (e.g., pip install <library-name>). 📦
Follow the steps provided for each project. 📋
Customize the code to your own needs and problem space. 🛠️
